## General Information
- Many itration required to find right alpha(lamda) for lasso or Ridge model
- Regularization using the Lasso regression & Ridge regression
- Many models to find optimal alpha for lasso & ridge regression model.
- Model and their coefficients when doubling optimal alpha.
- Lasso Model after dropping the top 5 features from optimal lasso model.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
